README

  Program 1 is designed to find the shortest path in directed and undirected graphs using Dijkstra's 
  algorithm. Program 2 is designed to find the minimum spanning tree of a given graph using Kruskal's 
  algorithm. 

EXECUTION

  This project is written in C++ and can be run using AWS. The project is split into 2 independent files.
  
  # go to project directory 
  $ cd Project_2

  # build project
  $ g++ main_sp.cpp -o test1 -std=c++11
  $ g++ main_mst.cpp -o test2 -std=c++11

  # command to run problem 1
  $ ./test1

  # command to run problem 2
  $ ./test2

INSTRUCTIONS

  After openning problem 1 select between graphs 1-8. 1-4 are undirected graphs. 5-8 are directed graphs.

  After openning problem 2 select between graphs 1-4. All graphs are undirected as MST do not work on directed.
