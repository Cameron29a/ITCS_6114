ITCS-6114 - Project 1

README

  This project is written in Java and can be run using AWS or any other Java compiler. 
  The project is a single file. Open the file and press run.

  The program generates random data sets of varying sizes and our sorting algorithms
  are then are tested with the same data sets. The runtimes for each sorting are stored
  based on data set size. After testing all methods are run with all data set sizes, the
  process repeats multiple times to obtain averages.
